[{"text": "Write a Python function to calculate factorial\nRecent Context:\n", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Here's a summary of the given answer in a nice structure and format:\n\n**What is Factorial?**\n\nA factorial is a mathematical operation where we multiply a number by all the positive integers that come before it. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is calculated as: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\n**Python Function to Calculate Factorial**\n\nWe have provided two Python functions to calculate the factorial of a given number:\n\n### Recursive Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factorial of a given number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input cannot be negative.\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * calculate_factorial(n-1)\n```\n\n### Iterative Solution\n\n```python\ndef calculate_factorial_iterative(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factorial of a given number using iteration.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    elif n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input cannot be negative.\")\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n```\n\nBoth functions take an integer as input and return its factorial. They also include some basic error handling to ensure that the input is a non-negative integer.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\n```python\nprint(calculate_factorial(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(calculate_factorial_iterative(5))  # Output: 120\n```\n\nThese functions demonstrate how to calculate the factorial of a given number using both recursion and iteration.", "metadata": {}}]
